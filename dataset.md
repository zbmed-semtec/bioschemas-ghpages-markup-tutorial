    "description": "Fleiss' kappa measuring inter-annotator agreement on a document-to-document relevance assessment task. The table contains 7 columns, the first one presents the topics, 8 in total. The second column shows the \"reference articles\", represented by their PubMed-ID and organized by topic. The third column shows the Fleiss’ Kappa results. The fourth column shows the interpretation of the Fleiss' Kappa results being: i) \"Poor\" results <0.20, ii) \"Fair\" results within 0.21 - 0.40, and iii) \"Moderate\" results within 0.41 - 0.60. The fifth column shows the PubMed-IDs of evaluation articles rated by the four annotators as \"Relevant\" regarding its corresponding \"reference article\". The sixth column shows the PubMed-IDs of evaluation articles rated by the four annotators as \"Partially relevant\" regarding its corresponding \"reference article\". The seventh column shows the PubMed-IDs of evaluation articles rated by the four annotators as \"Non-relevant\" regarding its corresponding \"reference article\".",
